## Dotfiles

Run `make.sh' to create a new dotfiles directory and symlink appropriate files.
On first time setup, install Vundle, as per their instructions:

```
$ git clone http://github.com/gmarik/vundle.git ~/.vim/bundle/vundle
```

* All dotfiles symlinked from `~/`
* Private and box specific bash settings held in `~/.bashrc-local`
* Backup of preferences held in `~/prefs/` and on Github [repo](https://github.com/cdmedia/prefs)
